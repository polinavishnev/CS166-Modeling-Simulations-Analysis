Welcome to the Grocery Store Simulation, a journey into queuing theory and discrete-event simulation. Experience a bustling grocery store, complete with checkout queues and cashiers. Dive into optimal cashier staffing and more.


### **Key Features:**

- **Object-Oriented Programming:**  This simulation uses OOP concepts, such as composition (e.g., a Grocery Store is composed of multiple Queues) to encode complex relationships between objects.

- **Queuing Theory:** Our simulation, based on the c*M/G/1 model, integrates queuing theory. Explore queue sizes, cashier and manager service times, and the probability of extended service using a priority queue. The assumption is that the customer will always choose the shortest queue.

- **Complex Parameters:** Parameters include queue count (up to 10), customer arrival rate (Î» = 1 customer per minute), cashier and manager service times, and extended service probability.

- **Realistic Closure:** After 8 pm, no new shoppers join queues. Existing shoppers are all served.


### **Collaboration:**

This project's analysis involved collaboration with Raphael Khalid, Arthur Kachur, and Kseniia Maslakova. My role focused on the coding aspect, contributing to the practical implementation of the simulation.

Explore the simulation, delve into code, and grasp the dynamics of modeling complex systems. Understand grocery store dynamics with theory and simulation. Let's explore the heart of retail dynamics! ðŸ›’ðŸ“Š
