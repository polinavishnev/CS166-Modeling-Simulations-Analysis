_The above shows the final version of the simulation. The distinct squares represent the car's positions. -2 nad -1 represent no car. 0 represents a stopped car. Speeds of 1+ represent moving cars. The words "GREEN" or "RED" represent the respective traffic light colors for the vertical lanes and the opposite color for the horizontal lane._


Experience vehicle dynamics through my Four-Way Intersection Simulation. Delve into complex traffic scenarios with a focus on:

- **Extended Nagel-Schreckenberg Model:** The Nagel-Schreckenberg model consists of a one-dimensional road, fixed cells, max speeds, desired speeds, reactions to others. This simulation constructs a two-dimensional grid with four roads, one intersections, and a traffic light synchronization.
- **Cellular Automata:** Explore the fusion of Cellular Automata (CA) and traffic dynamics on a two-dimensional grid. Experience vehicles moving step-by-step, each cell representing a discrete position. The color-coded grid reflects car speeds. CA orchestrates vehicle acceleration, deceleration, and random slowdowns, mirroring real-world traffic interactions.
- **Real-world Behavior:** Rooted in actual data from a Taipei intersection, our simulation captures real-world behavior. Arrival probabilities and traffic light durations are drawn from observations, offering an authentic portrayal of traffic dynamics.
- **HTML5 Visualization:** Gain real-time insights into the intricate behaviors of the vehicle system as it dynamically navigates the roads. Through visual representations and animations, track the flow of vehicles, observe their responses to changing conditions, and deepen your understanding of traffic dynamics in action.

Explore the simulation, dissect code, and immerse yourself in the heart of intricate traffic dynamics. Experience the road's ebb and flow through theory and simulation. ðŸš—ðŸš¦
