## Garbage Collection Simulation

Uncover the core elements driving my Garbage Collection Simulation, designed to address the complex vehicle routing problem in waste management while integrating key libraries and network theory.

- **Dynamic Framework:** The simulation mirrors real-world waste collection dynamics, tackling the intricacies of the vehicle routing problem.
- **NetworkX Empowerment:** Utilizing the NetworkX library, the simulation harnesses graph theory, embodying a Barabasi-Albert network with nodes representing farms, dropoff sites, and headquarters.
- **Strategic Parameters:** Fuel constraints, waste carrying capacity, and multiple salesmen (in form of trucks traversing the garbage collection system) create an authentic representation, setting the stage for waste collection optimization.
- **Algorithmic Precision:** Dijkstra's path algorithm is harnessed for calculating nearest neighbors and distances, enhancing route optimization within the network.
- **Temporal Alignment:** Each simulation time step corresponds to an hour, providing a finely-grained depiction of waste generation, accumulation, and collection dynamics.

Delve into the simulation to grasp the interplay between advanced algorithms, network theory, and real-world insights in navigating waste collection challenges. üöõüóëÔ∏è
