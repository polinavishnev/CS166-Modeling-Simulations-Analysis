## CS166 Modeling and Analyzing Complex Systems

Welcome to the exciting world of modeling complex systems! These are assignments from my course where I've used simulations to uncover how complex systems work:

### Grocery Store Queues Simulation ðŸ›’
Step into a virtual grocery store where I've simulated customer queues and cashier interactions, rooted in queueing theory. Experience real-world scenarios with customer lines and nuanced service times. Witness customers navigating queues, cashiers at work, and managers assisting in this dynamic simulation.

### Four-Way Intersection Traffic Simulation ðŸš¦
Explore Taipei, Taiwan, through a four-way intersection simulation coded using cellular automaton theory that is based on set rules for car movements, acceleration, and turns. Experiment with traffic light strategies for captivating simulations that blend traffic dynamics with creative solutions.

### Garbage Collection Simulation ðŸšš
Join me on a journey to optimize waste removal logistics. This assignment included designing algorithms that consider truck capacities, fuel limits, and varying waste production rates. I experimented with efficient schedules and routes that save fuel and maximize profit. This project explores the stochastic vehicle routing problem.

These assignments provide a sneak peek into the world of complex systems. If you're curious about more, check out the individual project folders. Inside, you'll find code, methods, and the art of modeling and analysis assignments. Let's explore this journey together! ðŸŒŸ
